# untitled-receipt-reader-app

## Statement of Purpose

This application will keep a running tally of food in your pantry and refrigerator. With this information, it can suggest meals based on what you have in your house, inform you when food is about to go bad, keep track of your consumption habits, and create a shopping list based on your remaining food. Users have multiple ways they can add to or remove from their virtual pantry. Single items can be added manually by the user, or quickly and automatically scanned in with the barcode reader. Users can also add items in bulk using the receipt reader; users simply take a picture of their receipt from the store, and the application will automatically add all the relevant purchases and quantities to the pantry. The user is also given the opportunity to update their pantry when they have used/finished an item (they will also be prompted to do so if they purchase a replacement if there is still some left in the pantry).
